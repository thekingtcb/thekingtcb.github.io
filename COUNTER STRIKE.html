		Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (abbreviated as CS:GO) is a multiplayer first-person 
		shooter video game developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve Corporation. It is 
		the fourth game in the main Counter-Strike franchise. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was 
		released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, with the 
		Linux version being released in September 2014. It features classic content, such as revamped 
		versions of classic maps, as well as brand new maps, characters and game modes. Cross-platform 
		multiplayer was planned between Windows, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation 3 players, but was ultimately 
		limited to Windows, OS X, and Linux because of the difference in update-frequency between systems.
